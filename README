NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::SyncVersions - Homogenise prerequisites so
    dependent versions are consistent

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
    This module exists to pose mostly as a workaround for potential bugs in
    downstream toolchains.

    Namely, CPAN.pm is confused when it sees:

        runtime.requires : Foo >= 5.0
        test.requires    : Foo >= 6.0

    It doesn't know what to do.

    This is an easy enough problem to solve if you're using "[Prereqs]"
    directly, and "[AutoPrereqs]" already does the right thing, but it gets
    messier when you're working with plugins that inject their own prereqs
    <https://github.com/dagolden/Path-Tiny/commit/c620171db96597456a182ea608
    8a24d8de5debf6>

    So this plugin will homogenise dependencies to be the same version in
    all phases which infer the dependency, matching the largest one found,
    so the above becomes:

        runtime.requires : Foo >= 6.0
        test.requires    : Foo >= 6.0
